## üîå Integration Points with Backend

### Market Data Integration
All market-related components require integration with the LMSR `MarketMaker` class:

**File**: `/Users/shawwalters/jeju/apps/caliguland/caliguland-game/src/game/market.ts`

**Key Methods to Import**:
```typescript
import { MarketMaker } from '../../game/market';

// For TradingPanel:
marketMaker.calculateSharesForTokens(outcome, tokens)
marketMaker.calculateBuyCost(outcome, shares)
marketMaker.calculatePriceImpact(outcome, shares)

// For MarketChart:
marketMaker.getMarketState()
marketMaker.getYesPrice()
marketMaker.getNoPrice()
```

### Game Engine Integration
Components require data from the `GameEngine` class:

**File**: `/Users/shawwalters/jeju/apps/caliguland/caliguland-game/src/game/engine.ts`

**Key Methods**:
```typescript
import { GameEngine } from '../../game/engine';

// For all components:
gameEngine.getCurrentGame()
gameEngine.placeBet(agentId, outcome, amount)
gameEngine.getAgentShares(agentId)

// For GameLobby:
gameEngine.joinLobby(agent)
gameEngine.getCurrentGame()

// For Leaderboard:
gameEngine.getReputationLeaderboard(limit)
```

### Real-Time Updates
Components should subscribe to game events via WebSocket or polling:

**Events to Handle**:
- `market_update` - Update prices and volume
- `day_changed` - Update game day and phase
- `betting_closed` - Disable trading
- `game_ended` - Show results
- `player_joined` - Update lobby list
- `chat_message` - Add to chat feed

## üéØ Next Steps for Integration

### 1. Connect to Backend
- [ ] Set up WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- [ ] Implement API calls to game engine endpoints
- [ ] Handle authentication and agent identity

### 2. LMSR Integration
- [ ] Import `MarketMaker` class into `TradingPanel`
- [ ] Replace approximation calculations with actual LMSR methods
- [ ] Connect `MarketChart` to historical price data

### 3. Chart Library
- [ ] Install charting library: `npm install recharts` or `npm install chart.js react-chartjs-2`
- [ ] Implement actual line chart in `MarketChart`
- [ ] Add interactive features (zoom, pan, tooltips)

### 4. State Management
- [ ] Consider adding Redux or Zustand for global state
- [ ] Implement context providers for game state
- [ ] Add optimistic updates for better UX

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for each component
- [ ] Test LMSR calculations accuracy
- [ ] Test real-time updates and edge cases
- [ ] Test responsive design on various devices

## üîí Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- All numeric inputs validated (min/max, type checking)
- Chat messages sanitized (max length enforced)
- Amount inputs protected against negative values

### Transaction Safety
- Confirmation modals for all trades
- Balance checks before submission
- Loading states prevent double-submission
- Error handling for failed transactions

---

## üé® Styling Guidelines

### Color Palette
- **Background**: `gray-800`, `gray-900`
- **Borders**: `gray-700`
- **Text**: `white`, `gray-300`, `gray-400`
- **YES (bullish)**: `green-400`, `green-600`
- **NO (bearish)**: `red-400`, `red-600`
- **Actions**: `blue-600`
- **Warnings**: `yellow-400`
- **Success**: `green-400`
- **Errors**: `red-400`

### Spacing
- Consistent padding: `p-4`, `p-6` for cards
- Gap spacing: `gap-2`, `gap-4`, `gap-6`
- Rounded corners: `rounded-lg` for cards, `rounded-full` for avatars

### Animations
- Transitions: `transition-colors`, `transition-all`
- Loading: `animate-pulse`
- Hover effects: `hover:bg-*` states
- Counter animations: Custom with `setInterval`
